- when click on croak in list, push new CroakDetailScreen.
- upon CroakDetailScreen build, get the replies of that croak
    - refer to croak store initially (unless they haven't been retrieved before), force api call when manual refresh. this should be very similar fetchCroaks() of FeedScreen
    -

CroakFeed should no longer check visibility of the croak list it's handed; that should be handled by the object that creates it

make AppState.lastCroaksGet int a Map<int, int> associating parent id to last time api called, so that it can be kept track of for each CroakDetailScreen


for submitting replies:
    - upon post success, have the new reply on the detail screen
    -
